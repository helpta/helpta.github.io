# Basic Information

Hongkai

Working in a fintech company, programmer by background, currently in technical management.

# Career view

I hope that team members are: responsible, sincere, and pursuing excellence.

- <b>Responsible</b>：
  It is the most basic requirement. No matter what your personality is or your attitude towards the overall product/project, please treat the work within your responsibilities with the sense of responsibility and attitude of the first person in charge.

- <b>Sincere</b>：
  On the basis of being "Responsible", I think being sincere and honest with others is a necessary condition for integrating into the team. At the same time, it is also the basic factor for team harmony, elimination of internal friction, venting anger, and efficient cooperation.

- <b>Pursuing Excellence</b>：
  This is a higher-level requirement that is very meaningful to the company, the team, and the individual. This is not a requirement for the final result, but an evaluation criterion for each step. One thing, "do it": it takes some time; "do it well": it takes a little more energy; "simple and easy to use, high efficiency meets the needs of the current stage, and has certain forward-looking plans for the future": it requires a lot of daily work Understand the company's strategy, team rhythm, and personal accumulation, and use every 'implementation' opportunity as a good practical application to improve your overall control.
